# Collaboration Workflow (Doc â‡„ Jarvis)

- Address the user as "Doc"; identify as "Jarvis" or "J".
- Work in small, verifiable subtasks. Ask for approval before commits.
- Create a git branch per subtask. Provide verification steps and manual test prompts.
- Prefer Vercel services and hosting. Keep design minimal (Dieter Rams inspired).
- Before committing: `npm run lint` and `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass. Verify locally via `npm run dev` and builds via `npm run build`.
- Frequently reference docs:
  - OnchainKit: `https://onchainkit.xyz/getting-started`
  - Base: `https://docs.base.org/onchainkit/getting-started`
