# TypeScript & React Conventions

- Use explicit types for function signatures and public exports; strict type checking is enabled.
- Prefer server components; add `"use client"` only when hooks/events or browser APIs are required.
- Avoid `any`; model unknowns with precise types and discriminated unions when possible.
- Use descriptive names (avoid 1â€“2 character identifiers). Keep functions small with early returns.
- Handle errors explicitly; avoid empty catch blocks.
- Organize imports: framework/libs, components, utils, styles. Remove unused imports.
- Use `@/*` path alias for absolute imports as configured in `tsconfig.json`.
- Keep JSX minimal and accessible: semantic tags, meaningful `alt`, and ARIA when needed.
- Match existing formatting; wrap long lines and avoid deep nesting.
