### Review: Homepage Tabs (Dashboard only)

#### Scope Reviewed
- Dashboard tab UI and disabled Swap/Earn tabs in `app/page.tsx`.
- Wallet/Identity header using OnchainKit components.
- Balance fetching and display.
- Providers and global styles for consistency.

#### Implementation Matches Plan
- Tabs are implemented client-side with local state. Dashboard is active; Swap/Earn are disabled.
- Header keeps `Wallet`, `ConnectWallet`, and dropdown with `Identity`, matching plan.
- Dashboard shows `Identity` block when connected.
- Native ETH balance fetched via `useBalance`; USDC via token address also via `useBalance`.

#### Gaps vs Plan
- Token list is limited to ETH and USDC only. Plan requested a small curated list (2–4 ERC-20s on Base) using `useReadContracts` or client calls and `formatUnits`, filtered and sorted. Consider adding at least 1–3 more tokens and filtering zero balances (already done) plus sorting by symbol.
- No explicit `formatUnits` used; relying on `useBalance.formatted`. That’s fine for tokens handled by `useBalance`, but if moving to `useReadContracts`, add explicit `formatUnits`.
- Tabs disabled state is present but `onClick` handlers are still attached. Minor: safe, but could omit `onClick` for disabled tabs to avoid confusion.

#### Code Quality & Style
- Simple, minimal Tailwind styling adheres to the Dieter Rams-inspired brief.
- Components and state are kept local to `app/page.tsx` per plan.
- Uses `isConnected` gate for identity block and handles loading/empty states.

#### Bugs / Issues
- `app/layout.tsx` appears malformed in one version of search results; ensure it returns JSX properly with `<html>` and `<body>` and valid `metadata`. The actual file should be validated at runtime/build.
- `:root` selector in `globals.css` is mistyped as `:root`? File shows both `:root` inside media and `::root` at top. Ensure the top-level selector is `:root`, not `::root`.

#### Recommendations
- Expand curated Base token list (e.g., `USDC`, `cbETH`, `cbBTC`, `DAI` on Base if applicable). Use `useReadContracts` to batch `balanceOf` and format with `formatUnits`. Filter zero balances and sort by symbol.
- Consider extracting a small `TokenBalances` component inside `app/page.tsx` for readability once the list grows, keeping scope local per plan.
- Remove `onClick` from disabled tabs to avoid accidental interactions.
- Verify `app/layout.tsx` correctness and fix `globals.css` root selector if needed.

#### Verification Steps
1) Connect a wallet with ETH and some USDC on Base.
2) Confirm Dashboard tab is active; Swap/Earn are disabled and non-interactive.
3) Verify Identity block shows Avatar, Name, Address, and ETH balance.
4) Verify Balances list shows ETH and USDC when non-zero; shows loading and empty states appropriately.
5) After expanding token list, confirm zero-balance tokens are hidden and sorting by symbol works.

#### Conclusion
Current implementation largely matches Phase 1 with ETH/USDC. To fully meet the brief, add a curated multi-token list using batched reads and sorting. Minor style/robustness tweaks recommended.
